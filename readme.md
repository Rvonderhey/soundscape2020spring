readme.md will contain a brief description of the content of my soundscape. Some sounds are current place holders for more 
refined versions later. Sounds I will be using also need slight refinement and tuning. The audio begins with typical sounds 
you would hear while getting ready. The setting shifts to the front door and eventually outside when you hear a knock at the 
door. The setting changes are marked by changes in the background music or lack thereof. The group of friends that have now 
met up will make thier way to a party. They are greeted at the door and let in. The sounds of the night are highlighted 
by the loud music, low rumble of voices, tinkling of glass, and the crack of cans. The soundscape currently ends when the 
group leaves through the front door. I would like to extend the audio to include one more setting after the party.
