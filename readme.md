readme.md will contain a brief description of the content of my soundscape. The audio begins with typical sounds 
you would hear while getting ready. The setting shifts to the front door and eventually outside after a knock at the 
door. The main character meets a group of friends and they walk to the party. The different settings are marked by changes in 
the background music or lack thereof. They are greeted at the door by the host and let in. The sounds of the night are 
highlighted by the loud music, low rumble of voices, and variety of drinks. The soundscape ends when the music fades and 
the group leaves through the front door.
